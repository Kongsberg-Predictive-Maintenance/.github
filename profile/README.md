## Remaining Useful Life - Predictive Maintenance

This Organization stores the entire code base for the [Thruster Remaining Useful Life](https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/services/kongsberg-remote-services/thruster-remaining-useful-life/) (RUL) project developed within Kongsberg. 

The Kongsberg backend team developed many independent libraries being part of the RUL product for: 
* data acquisition ([Baumer-Beckhoff DAQ system](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/beckhoff-data-acquisition) for torque and rpm measurements),
* analysis of driveline load signals ([error detection](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/kalman-filter), [Kalman filtering](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/kalman-filter)),
* analysis of driveline vibrational signals ([automated condition monitoring](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/automated-condition-monitoring)),
* [oil data analysis](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/oil),
* [cycle counting](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/cycle-counter) from time-series load signals,
* mechanical analyses of driveline components ([bearings](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/bearing), [gears](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/gears), shafts),
* mechanical analyses of thruster housing ([bolted joints](https://github.com/Kongsberg-Predictive-Maintenance/bolted-joint), housing itself).
